# Vaccine Slots Alert
Implemented a web application using Express.js and Mongoose in the backend which checks for available slots for the Covid-19 vaccination programme in India  through the public CoWin API and also built a sign in portal using Bootstrap where user can enter their details and get automated real time notification of any available slots for their age group in their District.
